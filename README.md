# Enneper: An ASM to MIF Compiler

![Enneper Surface](Enneper_Surface.png)

## Overview

Welcome to the Enneper project repository! Enneper is a specialized compiler that converts ASM (Assembly) code to MIF (Memory Initialization File) format. This compiler is an essential part of the SAPHO (Scalable Architecture Processor for Hardware Optimization) project at the NIPSCERN laboratory. Enneper is designed to ensure a sophisticated and efficient transformation process.

## Introduction

The Enneper compiler is a crucial component of the SAPHO project at NIPSCERN, dedicated to optimizing hardware processes. Named after the Enneper surface, this compiler symbolizes the elegant and complex transformation from ASM to MIF. The minimal surface of the Enneper structure represents the optimization and sophistication required in the compilation process.

## Features

- **Optimized for ASM to MIF:** Specifically tailored to convert Assembly code into Memory Initialization Files efficiently.
- **High Performance:** Ensures rapid and efficient transformation processes.
- **Sophisticated Transformation:** Handles complex ASM code with elegance and precision.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Provides detailed error messages and debugging support.
- **Extensible:** Easily extendable for future enhancements and optimizations.
